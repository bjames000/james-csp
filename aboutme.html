		  <p> My name is Ben james. I am a 17 year old highschool student who is a technology enthusiast and enjoys to program. I also enjoy motorsports and vehicles in general. In my free time I like to play xbox, listen to music, go for a drive/ride and most importantly hang out with my friends. I also play the drums since second grade, while at the same time play a little guitar on the side. </p>
