		  <p> In my program, abstraction is used in many ways. From the users perspective, all the user
	          <p> needs to know is how to initiate the program with enter() and how to answer the questions
		  <p> using letters and numbers and the program will eventually spit out a result. To the user,
		  <p> most of the code is abstraction to them because they don't care how it does it, they just
		  <p> care that it does what it is supposed to do. From the programmers point of view, many
		  <p> mathematical equations and other things are abstraction to the programmer, because
		  <p> like the user to the code, the programmer only cares that the code does what the programmer
		  <p> told it to do, and not what the code tells the software to do and so forth.
